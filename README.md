RM Books and Beyond is a literacy and empowerment organization launching an Industrial Literacy Programme targeting Grade 8–11 female learners. The programme aims to bridge the gender gap in Manufacturing and Infrastructure Development, equipping learners with industry-relevant knowledge, entrepreneurial skills, and exposure to 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies. Through mentorship, hands-on projects, and business training, learners will be prepared to innovate and lead in sectors traditionally dominated by men.
